[Model index](index.md)

Exact setup ID: `imaging/delaunay/hst/733f86e76ad924a71bda`.

Imported support is unreviewed; this page grants no baseline acceptance. Timing axes remain separate; no total fit-time prediction is made.

## Configuration

Identity limitations: Isolated to source row: legacy metadata is insufficient for cross-file joins.

## Hazards

No explicitly bound applicable evidence; this does not establish absence of hazards or validate a setting.

## Recommendations

No explicitly bound applicable evidence; this does not establish absence of hazards or validate a setting.

## Scripts

Navigation links identify the model family; they do not reconstruct historical settings or promise an executable replay.
