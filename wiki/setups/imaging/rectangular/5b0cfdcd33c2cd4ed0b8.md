# rectangular · jwst

[Model index](index.md)

Exact setup ID: `imaging/rectangular/jwst/d5a58fda12e2d73811fe`.

Imported support is unreviewed; this page grants no baseline acceptance. Timing axes remain separate; no total fit-time prediction is made.

## Configuration

Identity limitations: Isolated to source row: legacy metadata is insufficient for cross-file joins.

## Hazards

No explicitly bound applicable evidence; this does not establish absence of hazards or validate a setting.

## Recommendations

No explicitly bound applicable evidence; this does not establish absence of hazards or validate a setting.
